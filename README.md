# Distributed Queue Processing System

A fault-tolerant distributed worker-consumer system built using **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **AWS SQS** (LocalStack for local testing). The system manages dynamic queue assignment, scalable message processing, real-time job tracking, and includes race condition protection for concurrent queue assignments.

## üöÄ Recent Major Updates

- **Completion-Based Message Counting:** Jobs now update message count once at completion with accurate counts, fixing consumer reuse bugs and reducing IPC overhead
- **Jobs Tracking System:** Complete lifecycle tracking with automatic cleanup - job documents auto-purge after 5 days
- **Dynamic Concurrency Control:** Consumers now fetch queue-specific concurrency from database instead of using fixed environment variables
- **Enhanced Assignment Collection:** Assignment documents include queue ObjectId references for proper data relationships
- **AWS SDK v3:** Upgraded to modern, modular AWS SDK for better performance and maintenance
- **Queue Metadata Management:** Complete lifecycle management with concurrency control
- **One-Way Smart Sync:** DB ‚Üí SQS sync preserves ObjectIds while ensuring consistency
- **Enhanced CLI:** Professional queue management with concurrency configuration
- **nconf Configuration:** Centralized, environment-specific configuration management

## üìå Features

- **Master-Worker Architecture:** A centralized master assigns queues to workers. Each worker manages its own pool of consumers.
- **Comprehensive Jobs Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of queue processing with detailed lifecycle tracking, performance metrics, and status transitions.
- **Efficient Message Counting:** Jobs track total processed messages with single database update at completion, supporting consumer reuse and reducing IPC overhead.
- **Dynamic Concurrency Processing:** Consumers automatically fetch and apply queue-specific concurrency limits from the database, overriding global environment settings.
- **Enhanced Data Relationships:** Assignment documents include queue ObjectId references, enabling powerful aggregation queries and maintaining data integrity.
- **Race Condition Protection:** MongoDB unique indexes prevent duplicate queue assignments under high concurrent load.
- **Queue Metadata Management:** Complete queue lifecycle with concurrency control, creation tracking, and metadata sync.
- **Smart Queue Sync:** DB ‚Üí SQS one-way sync preserves MongoDB ObjectIds while creating missing SQS queues from database records.
- **Worker Load Balancing:** Queues are distributed based on worker load and capped using `MAX_LOAD`.
- **Auto-Setup:** Database indexes and configuration automatically created on system startup.
- **Professional CLI:** Clean, emoji-free command interface for production environments.
- **Modern Dependencies:** AWS SDK v3 with modular imports and improved performance.

## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Collections

### `queues`
**NEW:** Persistent queue metadata management
- `name`, `queueUrl`, `createdAt`, `concurrency` (1-5), `syncedAt`, `updatedAt`
- **Unique Indexes:** `name` and `queueUrl` prevent duplicates
- **Purpose:** Central source of truth for queue configuration and concurrency management

### `assignments` (Enhanced with Queue References)
Tracks queue assignment documents that map queues to workers during processing.
- **Queue ObjectId References:** Each assignment includes `queueId` linking to the `queues` collection for proper data relationships
- **Unique Index:** `queueUrl` field prevents duplicate assignments (race condition protection)
- **Ephemeral:** Documents created during assignment, deleted after message processing
- **Data Integrity:** Enables complex aggregation queries between assignments and queues collections

**Example Document:**
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId(...)",
  "queueUrl": "http://localhost:4566/000000000000/orders-queue",
  "worker": "worker_12345",
  "queueId": "ObjectId(...)"  // Reference to queues collection
}
```

### `workers`
Tracks active worker PIDs and their start time.

### `jobs` (NEW - Complete Lifecycle Tracking)
Comprehensive tracking for all queue processing operations with real-time status monitoring.

**Purpose:** Audit trail, performance monitoring, and operational visibility for queue processing.

**Document Structure:**
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId(...)",
  "queueName": "orders-processing",
  "queueUrl": "http://localhost:4566/000000000000/orders-processing",
  "queueId": "ObjectId(...)",  // Reference to queues collection
  "status": "running",         // queued | running | completed
  "messageCount": 23,          // Total messages processed
  "processor": {
    "workerPid": "12345",      // Worker that received assignment
    "consumerPid": "67890"     // Consumer actually processing messages
  },
  "createdAt": "2025-08-13T19:13:22.817Z",    // Job creation time
  "startedAt": "2025-08-13T19:13:45.123Z",    // Processing start time  
  "endedAt": "2025-08-13T19:14:12.456Z",      // Processing completion time
  "lastModified": "2025-08-13T19:14:12.456Z"  // Last status update
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Status Transitions:** Automatic tracking through queued ‚Üí running ‚Üí completed lifecycle
- **Completion-Based Counting:** Message count updated once at job completion for accuracy and performance
- **Performance Metrics:** Message counts, processing duration, timing analytics
- **Process Attribution:** Full traceability of which worker/consumer handled each job
- **Consumer Reuse Support:** Accurate counting across multiple consumer assignments
- **Efficient Indexing:** Compound indexes on `{status, createdAt}` and `{queueUrl, status}` for fast queries
- **Automatic Cleanup:** TTL index automatically purges job documents after 5 days from last modification

## üí° Use Cases

- Event-driven microservices needing parallel SQS message processing
- Systems requiring queue-specific tracking and audit logs
- Workload balancing in environments with multiple workers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Enhanced CLI Commands

The `sqs.js` CLI provides comprehensive queue management:

```bash
# Queue Management
node sqs.js create <name>                    # Create SQS queue
node sqs.js delete <name>                    # Delete SQS queue  
node sqs.js list                             # List all queues

# Message Operations  
node sqs.js send <name> <count>              # Send test messages
node sqs.js size <name>                      # Check message count

# Concurrency Management (NEW)
node sqs.js set-concurrency <name> <1-5>     # Configure queue concurrency
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Scaling

**Environment Configuration (nconf-based):**
- All settings managed via `env/development.json`
- AWS credentials, endpoints, and MongoDB URIs centrally configured
- Uses **LocalStack** (SQS) for local development, easily switchable to real AWS
- **Dynamic Concurrency:** Queue-specific concurrency fetched from database
- Consumer reuse and limit management via `CONSUMER_USAGE_LIMIT`
- Worker scaling via `WORKER_INSTANCES`

**Queue-Specific Concurrency Control:**
- Each queue in the `queues` collection has its own `concurrency` setting (1-5)
- Consumers automatically fetch and apply these limits at runtime
- Falls back to default (5) if queue not found in database
- Configure using: `node sqs.js set-concurrency <queue-name> <concurrency>`

## üìà Message Handling Capacity

- Default concurrency per consumer: 5
- One worker can spawn up to `MAX_LOAD` consumers (default 5)
- With 2 workers, the system can process up to **50 messages in parallel** (5 queues √ó 5 concurrent messages √ó 2 workers)
- Can be scaled horizontally by increasing `WORKER_INSTANCES` and running multiple master processes

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Verified Scenarios:**
- ‚úÖ Basic SQS Operations (create, delete, list, send, size)
- ‚úÖ Concurrency Management (set-concurrency with validation)
- ‚úÖ Master Startup & Database Sync (one-way DB ‚Üí SQS)
- ‚úÖ Single Master + Single Worker (message processing)
- ‚úÖ Multi-Worker Load Balancing (queue distribution)
- ‚úÖ Race Condition Protection (unique indexes prevent duplicates)
- ‚úÖ ObjectId Preservation (DB sync maintains MongoDB document IDs)
- ‚úÖ Error Handling (invalid inputs, missing queues, boundary conditions)

**Run Tests:**
```bash
npm install
npm test
```
